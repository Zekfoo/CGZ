As a follow-up to my [AGZ](https://github.com/Zekfoo/AGZ) project, I have once again redesigned original Game Boy hardware, this time with the Game Boy Color. Following my naming conventions for the AGZ, I've dubbed the PCB the *"CGZ-CPU-01"*, and the console itself the *"CGZ-001"*. This is a one-off production of what I envisioned as my ideal GBC.

Unlike my AGZ repo, I do not have a lengthy write-up for this design, since I didn't have any grievances with the original GBC hardware and my only design goal was to bring the same features of the AGZ over to the Game Boy Color.
